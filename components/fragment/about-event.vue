        It's the time to start something <Marked t="new" />,
        <Marked t="innovative" />, and <Marked t="trust the magic" /> of new
        beginnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <Marked t="TEDxYouth@FayoumSTEM" priority="med" /> is pleased to start
        raising the level of challenge, urging our attendees to our official
        publication of <Marked t="Perseids" priority="med" />
        <Marked t=" Event: Fay Innovate Your Way" />.
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be our speakers, the <Marked t="innovators" /> that we trust
        to have a great impact.

        Thinking about the <Marked t="Perseids" priority="med" /> as the lead
        that innovate us by the letter of <Marked t='"i"' /> in
        <Marked t="perseids" priority="med" /> which represents the innovation
        of <Marked t="TEDxYouth@FayoumSTEM" priority="med" />. However, what do
        you think is the meaning of <Marked t="Fay" /> which is the abbreviation
        of <Marked t="Fayoum" priority="med" />, but <Marked t="FAY" /> is more
        than that. What do you think that <Marked t="FAY" /> represents to
        innovate your way?
